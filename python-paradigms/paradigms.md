freedom comes the dilemma of having too many choices, or in the way that Schwartz phrases it as, "the paradox of choice".

In my endeavor to narrow down the best approaches for solving various types of problems, I sought out to understand
programming paradigms.

These are my notes that I compiled together from a myriad of sources.
