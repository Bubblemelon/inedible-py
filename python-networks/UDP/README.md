### UDP
> A simple UDP server-client program.
>
> This directory contains `UDPClient.py` and `UDPServer.py`. These scripts simply model the client-server model using the User Datagram Protocol.
>
> Run `python3 UDPServer.py` first then run `python3 UDPClient.py`.
> After the server indicates that it is ready, input a lower case word/sentence on the client program. The word/sentence should be sent back in all uppercase characters.
>
> Comments in `UDPClient.py` and `UDPServer.py` details the logic behind these programs.
