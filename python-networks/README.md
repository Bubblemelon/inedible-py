A simple UDP Client and Server program. Execute the Client program to send a string message to the UDP Sever. The string message is then sent back to the Client in capitalized form (all uppercase characters) and the Client program terminates. 

### [UDP_Pinger](/inedible-py/python-networks/UDP_Pinger)
A Client program that pings the UDP Server program with a given message string,
and an optional number of pings. Completes the number of pings by ending with
ping statistics similar to `iputil`.

Extented functionality of UDP Client and Server from [UDP](/inedible-py/python-networks/UDP) directory.
